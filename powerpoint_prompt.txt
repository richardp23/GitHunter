This challenge incorporates today’s current LLM offerings into Microsoft’s PowerPoint tool. You are tasked with utilizing development tools provided by Microsoft for PowerPoint, using Typescript or Javascript.
Challenge Overview
Build a Microsoft PowerPoint add-in that lets users use AI to create and enhance slides inside PowerPoint. The add-in should support generating slide content from prompts, transforming rough notes into well-structured slides, and doing lightweight research that can be cited or summarized into slide-ready bullets. You can use any LLM provider. This only needs to run in a development environment.

Baseline
PowerPoint add-in UI (task pane) with prompt input + output preview
Insert AI-generated content onto the current slide (title, bullets, speaker notes, images/diagrams optional)
At least one “research” workflow (e.g., summarize a topic, compare options, generate pros/cons, provide sources)
Stretch ideas (pick what’s cool)
Template-driven generation: user creates bracketed variables + AI populates with real data
“Make it consistent”: align terminology, tense, voice across a deck
Multi-slide mode: generate an outline and create a 5–10 slide mini-deck
Anything else you think would be cool!

Development Overview
API Providers
You are welcome to choose any LLM provider to work with. Below is a list of today’s popular LLM choices:
OpenAI (GPT-4x, GPT 5x, GPT 3.5)
Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 3.5, 4.5)
Gemini 
Regardless of your model selection, interacting with a LLM boils down to the same mental model: 
Input prompt → LLM → structured text output
API Keys
ToltIQ has provided temporary development API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic to support this hackathon. Please reach out to Steiner for access.
These keys:
Are for development and demo use only
Provide access to current Anthropic and OpenAI models
Will expire shortly after the hackathon ends
Usage Guidelines
These are shared keys across all participants
Please avoid excessive or automated request spamming
Be mindful of retries, loops, and unnecessary calls
If something breaks due to overuse, everyone feels it 🙂


Designing a solution
Your solution will likely have two primary components:
UX (HTML/CSS) 
Visual components a user interacts with within your custom PowerPoint task pane
JavaScript / Typescript 
Local components to handle PowerPoint API interactions & LLM API calls 

To start, set up your development environment and follow some of Microsoft’s provided PowerPoint add-in tutorials. While you do this, brainstorm some features you may want to build, for example:
Summarize a topic and insert a slide
Generate a slide of pros / cons 
Provide high-level sources given a topic
Fact check a selection of slides
Generate a chart
Apply a theme to every slide
Remember: The goal here is to explore, broaden your skills, and get creative!
Dev Envr Setup
Microsoft provides 2 developer options for working with PowerPoint: 1) task-pane add-ons via a Javascript API and 2) content add-in’s via Visual Studio. For this challenge, the PowerPoint Javascript API is recommended for this challenge (option 1). Visual Studio requires a Windows development space, but could be incorporated for visual enhancements. 

Tips: 
Install formatting/linter extensions for Javascript/Typescript and HTML in your IDE
Getting Started with the Javascript API
Follow the steps listed in this Microsoft guide, from the “Prerequisites” section to the “Try It Out” section. This add-in tutorial goes a bit further in depth with how to work with the task pane resources as well. These guides will get you set up with a development environment and workflow.

Microsoft also provides a basic tutorial guide that walks through calling basic PowerPoint operations via the JS API. 

Otherwise, use the JS API Documentation provided to guide you while you develop.
Making LLM API Requests
Calling an LLM provider API directly from a PowerPoint add-in task pane is blocked by browser CORS policies and is a security risk for API keys. The recommended solution is to use a backend proxy service to forward requests securely; refer to the section titled Handling CORS for implementation details.

Note to Mac Users
⚠️ If you are developing on a Mac, I’d recommend the following set up:
Download PowerPoint from Microsoft 365 NOT from the mac store
In order to enable console/log viewability while testing your add-in, you must enable the com.microsoft.Powerpoint OfficeWebAddinDeveloperExtras variable, which is not supported by the Mac Store version of PowerPoint (aka it will be very hard to see log/console output if you use Mac store version)
When using yo office to create your add-in template directory, select “Office Add-in Task Pane Project” instead of the unified manifest option. 
The Microsoft 365 version of PowerPoint for Mac does not support unified-manifest add-ins. Your add-in must have a .xml extension to be supported and recognized by PowerPoint.
To enable console/logging viewability when testing, follow the steps outlined here
LLM Prompting
LLMs behave much better when you tell them the slide format explicitly.

For example: 

Create content for a PowerPoint slide.

Topic: Cloud Security Basics

Return:
- A short slide title (max 8 words)
- 4–6 bullet points (1 line each, concise)
- Optional speaker notes (2–3 sentences)

Tone: professional, clear, non-marketing

What to focus on, what not to focus on
Prioritize:
A user friendly UX
Clear AI workflows 
Usefulness when integrated into a PowerPoint workflow

Don’t Stress About:
Model fine-tuning
Streaming tokens / token  tracking
Vector databases
Long-term LLM memory
Perfect citations (a URL is good enough)

Troubleshooting
If your task-pane add in is not showing up:
Note (these are from working on a mac)
Run npx office-addin-dev-certs install, restart the dev server and Powerpoint, and run `npm start` again
 Optionally, run npx office-addin-dev-certs uninstall first
